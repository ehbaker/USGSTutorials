# Help! What is GitHub?

### Q: Why are we using GitHub to share code?
### A: It allows for easy collaboration - it's like a combination of social media and wikipedia, for coding! Nerd :)

To use GitHub, you must first have a program called **Git** installed on your computer. It tracks changes in your code (version control).

To Install GitHub, follow these directions from Software Carpentry:

2. Run the installer and follow the steps bellow:
..* Click on "Next".
..* Click on "Next".
..* Keep "Use Git from the Windows Command Prompt" selected and click on "Next". 
..* Click on "Next".
..* Keep "Checkout Windows-style, commit Unix-style line endings" selected and click on "Next".
..* Keep "Use Windows' default console window" selected and click on "Next".
..* Click on "Install".
..* Click on "Finish".
3. If your "HOME" environment variable is not set (or you don't know what this is):
..* Open command prompt (Open Start Menu then type cmd and press [Enter])
..* Type the following line into the command prompt window exactly as shown:
setx HOME "%USERPROFILE%"
